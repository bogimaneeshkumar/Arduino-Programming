IR SENSOR will detect the obstacle and immidiately turn ON the buzzer. So if IR sensor is LOW then buzzer will be HIGH. Hence its the working of IR Sensor.
LDR SENSOR will be detecting the intensity of light falling on it. If the LDR intensity is lesser than 105 then it will on the buzzer else it will keep the buzzer OFF.
Ultrasonic SENSOR will send the ultrasonic waves which will travel and reflects back from the obstacle. So we just calculated the distance from the object and display it on the terminal through the following code.
